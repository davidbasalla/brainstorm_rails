## Instructions

Click to select a Node. Select and drag to move a Node. 

Click and drag on empty space to select multiple Nodes. Click on one of these nodes and drag to move all nodes. 

Double-click on a Node to edit text and color.

Click the 'x' on a Node to delete it.

Click on the small black box below a Node and drag to create a Connection. Drag the connection over another Node to complete a Connection.
